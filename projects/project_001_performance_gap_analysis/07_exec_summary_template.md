# 07 Executive Summary Template

## Situation
Delivery productivity has declined and project timelines are slipping across key service lines. This is eroding margins, delaying revenue recognition, and increasing client dissatisfaction.

## Complication
If unaddressed, delays will continue to compound—driving higher rework costs, missed contractual commitments, and increased churn risk. Operational strain is already creating capacity bottlenecks and reducing the ability to take on new work.

## Resolution
Implement a phased improvement plan focused on standardizing delivery workflows, rebalancing workloads, targeted upskilling for critical roles, and selective tooling upgrades in high‑friction stages.

## Business Impact
- Productivity improvement of 8–12% over 12 months.
- Reduction in delivery delays by 10–15% within 6–9 months.
- Margin recovery of 5–7% through lower rework and overruns.
- Reduced operational risk from clearer governance and capacity planning.

## Call to Action
Approve the phased roadmap, confirm funding for tooling and training investments, and assign executive sponsors to drive adoption across delivery and PMO.
