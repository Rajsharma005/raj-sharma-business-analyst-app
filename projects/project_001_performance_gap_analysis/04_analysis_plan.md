# 04 Analysis Plan

## Analysis Objectives (Mapped to Hypotheses)
1. Quantify where in the delivery lifecycle delays and productivity losses occur.
2. Determine whether process bottlenecks, capability gaps, or workload imbalance are the dominant drivers.
3. Validate whether tooling limitations and governance gaps materially impact outcomes.
4. Prioritize root causes by impact on SLA adherence, margin, and customer satisfaction.

## KPI & Metric Logic
- **Delivery Timeliness:** on-time rate, cycle time by phase, schedule variance.
- **Productivity:** output per FTE, billable utilization, throughput per team.
- **Quality & Rework:** rework rate, defect escape rate, client escalations.
- **Capacity & Demand:** workload-to-capacity ratio, intake vs staffed capacity.
- **Governance:** change request volume, approval cycle time, priority overrides.

## Analysis Techniques (Logic Only)
- **Trend analysis:** identify when the decline began and whether it is accelerating.
- **Variance analysis:** compare high-performing vs low-performing teams or periods.
- **Cohort analysis:** compare outcomes by role tenure, project type, or client segment.
- **Correlation analysis:** link bottlenecks (handoff wait, rework) to delivery delays.
- **Process stage analysis:** locate phases where cycle time expansion is concentrated.

## Expected Outputs
- Driver ranking that quantifies relative contribution to delays and productivity loss.
- Evidence-backed narrative for leadership on root causes and trade-offs.
- Prioritized opportunity list aligned to operational levers and ownership.
