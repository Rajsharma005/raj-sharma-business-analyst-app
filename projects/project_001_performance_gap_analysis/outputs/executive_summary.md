# Executive Summary

## Situation
The business is facing a sustained delivery efficiency decline within a service-based SaaS environment, materially impacting on-time performance, margin predictability, and stakeholder confidence.

## Complication
If unaddressed, continued delivery slippage will further erode client trust, increase rework costs, and introduce escalating operational and financial risk.

## Resolution
Execute a two-track approach: immediate stabilization actions to arrest near-term leakage, alongside targeted structural fixes to address root causes across process design, governance, and workload management.

## Impact
Expected outcomes include improved delivery predictability, reduced operational leakage, and restored stakeholder confidence within 1–2 quarters, without incremental headcount.

## Call-to-Action
Approve the prioritized execution plan and assign accountable owners to initiate immediate stabilization within the next operating cycle.

## Priorities
- **P1:** Tighten operational playbooks in the highest-impact delivery segments (Owner: Operations)
- **P2:** Redesign core process flows to eliminate high-friction handoffs (Owner: Operations)
- **P3:** Introduce governance checkpoints for high-risk delivery decisions (Owner: Finance)
