# 02 Hypothesis Building

## Key Hypotheses
- H1: Process inefficiencies in core delivery workflows are the primary driver of productivity decline and delivery delays.
- H2: Skill gaps in critical roles are causing rework and lower throughput.
- H3: Workload imbalance across teams and projects is creating bottlenecks and missed deadlines.
- H4: Planning and estimation accuracy has deteriorated, leading to unrealistic timelines and downstream delays.

## Sub-Hypotheses
- H1a: Handoffs between functions introduce avoidable cycle time and rework.
- H1b: Non‑standardized processes result in variability in delivery speed and quality.
- H2a: Key roles (e.g., senior analysts, project leads) are under‑staffed or lack required competencies.
- H2b: Training and onboarding gaps are increasing error rates and rework.
- H3a: High‑priority projects are over‑allocated to the same teams, causing queue buildup.
- H3b: Resource allocation does not align with project complexity and SLAs.
- H4a: Estimates are systematically optimistic relative to historical delivery performance.
- H4b: Scope changes are not fully captured in revised timelines or resourcing plans.

## Data Needed to Validate
- Process cycle times by stage, handoff counts, and rework rates.
- Delivery quality metrics (defects, client escalations, rework hours).
- Role‑level capacity, utilization, and skill/competency assessments.
- Training completion records and onboarding timelines.
- Project workload distribution, queue lengths, and SLA adherence by team.
- Historical estimates vs. actuals, including change‑order history and scope growth.

## Potential Confounders
- Seasonality in demand or client mix shifts affecting delivery complexity.
- Data quality gaps in time tracking or inconsistent project coding.
- External dependencies (vendor delays, client approvals) inflating cycle time.
- Concurrent tooling changes or system outages impacting productivity.
- Hawthorne effect from teams changing behavior during the analysis period.
