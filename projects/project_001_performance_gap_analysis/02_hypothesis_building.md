# 02 Hypothesis Building

## Key Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Process bottlenecks are the primary driver of delivery delays.
- **Sub-hypotheses**
  - Handoffs between teams introduce avoidable wait time.
  - Rework rates have increased due to inconsistent quality gates.
  - Approval cycles are longer than required due to unclear decision rights.
- **Data needed**
  - End-to-end cycle time by phase and team.
  - Handoff wait time and rework incidence by project.
  - Approval timestamps and escalation logs.
- **Confounders / biases**
  - Project complexity mix may have shifted.
  - Seasonality or client-driven scope changes.

### Hypothesis 2: Capability gaps are reducing throughput and quality.
- **Sub-hypotheses**
  - Specific roles show higher error or rework rates.
  - New hires or contractors have lower productivity than tenured staff.
  - Training coverage is inconsistent across teams.
- **Data needed**
  - Productivity and quality metrics by role and tenure.
  - Training completion and certification records.
  - Rework attribution by contributor or team.
- **Confounders / biases**
  - Incomplete time tracking or inconsistent role definitions.
  - Team leaders may underreport skill gaps.

### Hypothesis 3: Workload imbalance is driving local bottlenecks and missed SLAs.
- **Sub-hypotheses**
  - A small subset of teams carry a disproportionate share of critical work.
  - Staffing levels are misaligned with demand volatility.
  - Project intake exceeds capacity planning assumptions.
- **Data needed**
  - Utilization and capacity by team and month.
  - Project intake vs staffing plans.
  - SLA compliance by team and project type.
- **Confounders / biases**
  - Unplanned client requests not captured in intake data.
  - Variability in project scope documentation.

### Hypothesis 4: Tooling and system limitations increase manual effort and cycle time.
- **Sub-hypotheses**
  - Manual data entry or reconciliation creates delays.
  - System latency or downtime affects delivery throughput.
  - Lack of automation forces redundant work across teams.
- **Data needed**
  - Time spent on manual steps by phase.
  - System uptime and incident logs.
  - Automation coverage by workflow.
- **Confounders / biases**
  - Teams may use unofficial workarounds not recorded in systems.
  - Reported downtime may not correlate with productivity loss.

### Hypothesis 5: Governance and prioritization gaps are creating delivery drift.
- **Sub-hypotheses**
  - Priority shifts occur mid‑delivery without formal change control.
  - Executive escalation patterns override standard scheduling discipline.
  - Project success criteria are not consistently enforced.
- **Data needed**
  - Change request logs and approval cadence.
  - Escalation records and priority overrides.
  - Variance between planned and actual scope.
- **Confounders / biases**
  - Incomplete change tracking across teams.
  - Client-side delays misattributed to internal governance.
