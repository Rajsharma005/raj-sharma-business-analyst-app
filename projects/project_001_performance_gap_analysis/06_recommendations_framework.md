# 06 Recommendations Framework

## Short-Term (0–60 days)
1. **Standardize handoff checklists and quality gates for top 3 delivery phases**
   - **Owner:** Delivery Operations
   - **Effort:** Low
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Why:** Reduces avoidable rework and compresses cycle time quickly.
   - **Risks/Dependencies:** Requires alignment with team leads and consistent enforcement.

2. **Rebalance workloads across teams based on active capacity**
   - **Owner:** PMO / Resource Management
   - **Effort:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Why:** Unlocks existing capacity without hiring.
   - **Risks/Dependencies:** Needs accurate capacity data and strong change management.

## Mid-Term (60–120 days)
3. **Targeted upskilling for high-rework roles and teams**
   - **Owner:** Functional Team Leads + L&D
   - **Effort:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Medium–High
   - **Why:** Addresses root skill gaps driving rework and delays.
   - **Risks/Dependencies:** Requires time allocation away from delivery work.

4. **Introduce structured scope-change governance**
   - **Owner:** PMO / Executive Sponsor
   - **Effort:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Why:** Prevents uncontrolled scope expansion and protects delivery timelines.
   - **Risks/Dependencies:** Executive sponsorship required to enforce discipline.

## Long-Term (120+ days)
5. **Redesign delivery workflow to reduce manual steps and duplicated approvals**
   - **Owner:** COO / Ops Excellence
   - **Effort:** High
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Why:** Structural reduction in cycle time and cost-to-serve.

## Trade-offs & Decision Points
- Prioritize speed-to-impact (handoff standardization, workload rebalance) before investing in structural redesign.
- Accept short-term delivery disruption to enable skill upgrades that create longer-term stability.
- Invest in governance to protect client commitments even if it slows scope changes.
