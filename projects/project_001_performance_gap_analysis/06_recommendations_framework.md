# 06 Recommendations Framework

## Recommendations Summary
### Short-Term (0–3 months)
- Standardize core delivery workflows and handoff checklists for highest-volume project types.
  - Owner: PMO Director + Delivery Ops Lead
  - Implementation effort: Medium
  - Expected impact: Reduce cycle time variance; improve on‑time delivery rate by 5–8%.
  - Trade-offs/risks/dependencies: Requires rapid alignment across teams; risk of resistance to change.
- Rebalance active project loads across teams to reduce over‑allocation (>95% utilization).
  - Owner: Resource Manager
  - Implementation effort: Low–Medium
  - Expected impact: Fewer delivery bottlenecks; reduce missed milestones by 10–15%.
  - Trade-offs/risks/dependencies: May require renegotiating timelines with clients.

### Mid-Term (3–9 months)
- Launch targeted upskilling program for senior delivery roles and high‑complexity project workstreams.
  - Owner: L&D Lead + Functional Team Leads
  - Implementation effort: Medium
  - Expected impact: Reduce defect and rework rates by 10–12%; improve productivity per FTE.
  - Trade-offs/risks/dependencies: Short-term capacity impact during training; needs leadership sponsorship.
- Implement a standardized project estimation and scope-change governance process.
  - Owner: PMO Change Manager
  - Implementation effort: Medium
  - Expected impact: Improve schedule accuracy; reduce variance by 8–10%.
  - Trade-offs/risks/dependencies: Requires adoption across delivery and sales.

### Long-Term (9–18 months)
- Invest in workflow automation and tooling upgrades for high-friction stages (requirements, QA, approvals).
  - Owner: CIO/IT + Delivery Ops
  - Implementation effort: High
  - Expected impact: Sustained productivity gains; reduce cycle times by 12–18%.
  - Trade-offs/risks/dependencies: Capital expenditure approval; change management required.
- Build a continuous capacity planning and demand forecasting model.
  - Owner: Finance + PMO
  - Implementation effort: High
  - Expected impact: Stabilized utilization at 80–90%; reduced workload volatility.
  - Trade-offs/risks/dependencies: Requires consistent data feeds and forecasting discipline.

## Expected Impact
- 10–15% reduction in delivery delays within 6–9 months.
- 8–12% improvement in productivity per FTE over 12 months.
- 5–7% improvement in project margin through reduced rework and overruns.

## Effort and Complexity
- Low–Medium: workload rebalancing, workflow checklist standardization.
- Medium: upskilling programs, estimation governance.
- High: tooling modernization, capacity forecasting.

## Risks and Dependencies
- Resistance to process change from delivery teams.
- Data quality gaps may slow rollout of governance and forecasting models.
- Tooling investments depend on budget cycles and IT capacity.

## Next Steps
- Socialize recommendations with PMO and delivery leadership.
- Prioritize quick wins and assign owners with timelines.
- Build implementation roadmap aligned to quarterly planning cycles.
