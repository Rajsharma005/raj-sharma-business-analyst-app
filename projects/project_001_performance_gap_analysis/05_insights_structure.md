# 05 Insights Structure

## Observations (What the data shows)
- Cycle time has expanded most in handoff-heavy phases (requirements → build → QA).
- Rework incidence is higher in projects staffed with new or rotating team members.
- Utilization variability across teams is widening, indicating uneven workload distribution.
- Projects with frequent scope changes show materially lower on-time delivery rates.

## Insights (What it means for the business)
- **Process friction is the leading driver of delivery delays.** Handoff-heavy phases are where most of the cycle time growth sits, suggesting workflow design—not effort—is the bottleneck.
- **Capability gaps are amplifying rework and slowing throughput.** Skill inconsistency is driving avoidable rework, which compounds delays and increases cost-to-serve.
- **Workload imbalance is masking overall capacity.** Some teams are overloaded while others remain underutilized, indicating a capacity allocation problem rather than a pure headcount problem.
- **Governance drift is eroding delivery discipline.** Uncontrolled scope changes are extending timelines and masking accountability for schedule variance.

## Hypothesis Outcomes (Supported vs Rejected)
- **Supported:** Process bottlenecks, capability gaps, workload imbalance, governance drift.
- **Partially supported:** Tooling limitations (impact localized to specific teams).
- **Rejected:** Broad demand collapse as the primary driver.

## Business Impact Summary
- Delivery delays are reducing margin through rework and non-billable effort.
- Client trust risk is rising as SLA performance becomes inconsistent.
- Without intervention, the organization will require incremental capacity to maintain current output.
