# Executive Summary — Project 001: Performance Gap Analysis

## 1. Business Context
- **Company type:** Mid-size, service-based organization delivering client projects at scale.
- **Strategic risk:** Eroding delivery performance is compressing margins, weakening client trust, and putting renewal revenue at risk.
- **Why leadership should care now:** The performance gap has persisted across multiple quarters, indicating a structural issue that will worsen without decisive intervention.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **What is broken:** Delivery productivity and on-time performance have declined, creating missed commitments and escalating client pressure.
- **What success looks like:** Restored delivery reliability, improved productivity per FTE, and reduced rework—without adding headcount.
- **If nothing is done:** Margin erosion accelerates, escalations increase, and renewal risk compounds as clients lose confidence.

## 3. Key Findings (Insights)
- Process friction—not effort—is the primary drag on delivery speed and predictability.
- Capability gaps are amplifying rework and undermining throughput in critical roles.
- Workload imbalance masks real capacity and drives localized bottlenecks.
- Governance drift is extending timelines and blurring accountability.

## 4. Root Causes (People / Process / Technology / Governance)
- **People:** Skill coverage is inconsistent in high-impact roles; onboarding and training lag demand shifts.
- **Process:** Handoffs and quality gates are uneven, creating avoidable delays and rework.
- **Technology:** Tooling gaps are localized; manual steps persist in critical workflows.
- **Governance:** Scope changes and priority shifts are not consistently controlled or enforced.

## 5. Business Impact
- **Revenue & margin:** Continued slippage will increase cost-to-serve and compress margins through rework and non-billable effort.
- **SLA & customer:** Missed milestones elevate escalation risk and threaten renewal outcomes.
- **Operational risk:** Without intervention, additional capacity will be required just to maintain current output.

## 6. Recommendations (Prioritized)
1. **Standardize handoffs and quality gates across the top delivery phases**
   - **Owner:** Delivery Operations
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Effort:** Low
   - **Time horizon:** 30–60 days

2. **Rebalance workloads using capacity-based allocation rules**
   - **Owner:** PMO / Resource Management
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Effort:** Medium
   - **Time horizon:** 30–60 days

3. **Targeted upskilling in high‑rework roles**
   - **Owner:** Functional Leads + L&D
   - **Impact:** Medium–High
   - **Effort:** Medium
   - **Time horizon:** 60–90 days

## 7. Leadership Ask
- **Decision required:** Approve the prioritized improvement plan and assign accountable owners with authority to enforce new delivery standards.
- **Trade-offs:** Accept short-term disruption to enable process discipline and skill upgrades that restore long-term performance.
