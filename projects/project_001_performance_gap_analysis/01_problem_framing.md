# 01 Problem Framing

## Business Context
A mid-sized, service-based company is experiencing a sustained decline in delivery productivity and increasing schedule slippage across client projects. Over the past 12–18 months, delivery lead times have expanded, utilization has fallen, and margin erosion has begun to appear in quarterly results. Customer confidence is weakening as milestone commitments are missed. Leadership suspects a mix of process inefficiencies and capability gaps, but no solution has been chosen.

## Problem Statement
Delivery performance is deteriorating, creating missed commitments, margin pressure, and rising client escalations. The organization lacks a fact-based, end-to-end view of the root causes and must identify which drivers materially explain the decline and where intervention will produce the highest impact.

## Objectives
- Establish the magnitude and timeline of the productivity and delivery gap relative to historical baselines.
- Isolate the primary drivers of delays across process, staffing, and skill dimensions.
- Quantify the impact of each driver on margin, utilization, and client outcomes.
- Deliver a prioritized, actionable improvement plan that leadership can approve and fund.

## Stakeholders
- Executive leadership (CEO/COO): accountable for operational performance and investment decisions.
- Delivery operations & PMO: accountable for execution discipline, throughput, and scheduling.
- Functional team leads: accountable for staffing, training, and adherence to delivery standards.
- Finance: accountable for margin impact, forecasting accuracy, and cost-to-serve.
- Customer success/account management: accountable for client satisfaction, renewals, and escalations.

## Scope and Constraints
- **In scope:** end-to-end service delivery workflow, resourcing models, skill alignment, and handoff points across teams.
- **Time window:** last 12–18 months to capture the trend and current operating state.
- **Out of scope:** product redesign, major pricing changes, or new market initiatives unless directly tied to delivery performance.
- **Constraints:** inconsistent data hygiene across teams; limited bandwidth from senior delivery leaders during peak periods.

## Success Metrics
- On-time delivery rate restored to target SLA range.
- Productivity per FTE improved versus the 12‑month baseline.
- Reduction in project overruns and rework incidence.
- Improved client satisfaction and a measurable decline in escalations.

## Assumptions and Risks
- Assumes operational data can be normalized to compare teams and time periods.
- Risk that qualitative drivers (morale, leadership stability) are underrepresented in structured data.
- Risk of bias toward easily measured process issues while underestimating skill or capacity gaps.
- Risk of change resistance if interventions are perceived as top-down or punitive.
