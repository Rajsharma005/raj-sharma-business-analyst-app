# 01 Problem Framing

## Business Context
The company is a mid-sized, service-based provider experiencing a sustained decline in productivity alongside increasing delivery delays. Revenue growth has slowed due to project overruns, and customer satisfaction has begun to decline. Leadership believes the root causes may include inefficient internal processes and skill gaps across delivery teams, but no solution has been predetermined.

## Problem Statement
Productivity has decreased and delivery timelines are slipping, resulting in missed commitments and margin pressure. The organization lacks a fact-based understanding of the drivers behind these performance gaps and needs a structured analysis to identify and prioritize root causes.

## Objectives
- Quantify the current performance gap versus historical baselines and contractual commitments.
- Identify and validate the primary drivers of productivity decline and delivery delays.
- Assess the relative impact of process inefficiencies versus skill gaps.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations to improve delivery performance and customer outcomes.

## Stakeholders
- Executive leadership (CEO/COO) — accountability for operational performance.
- Delivery operations and project management — ownership of execution and resourcing.
- Functional team leads — responsibility for staffing, training, and process adherence.
- Finance — impact on margins, utilization, and forecast accuracy.
- Customer success/account management — impact on client satisfaction and renewals.

## Scope and Constraints
- Scope includes core service delivery processes, staffing models, and skills alignment across delivery teams.
- Initial focus is on the last 12–18 months of projects and operational data.
- Excludes major product or pricing changes unless directly tied to delivery performance.
- Constraints include limited data standardization across teams and time-bound stakeholder availability.

## Success Metrics
- Improvement in on-time delivery rate versus current baseline.
- Increase in productivity (output per FTE or per billable hour).
- Reduction in project overruns and rework rates.
- Improved customer satisfaction scores and fewer delivery escalations.

## Assumptions and Risks
- Assumes operational data is sufficiently reliable to compare teams and time periods.
- Risk that qualitative factors (e.g., morale, change fatigue) are underrepresented in data.
- Potential resistance to process changes or skill assessments.
- Risk of attributing delays to skills when process bottlenecks are the primary driver (or vice versa).
